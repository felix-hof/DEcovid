TODO:

- improve summary technique (there surely is something more efficient than downsizing everything to the lowest level and then summarise again.
- summarise temperature with population weights.
- add function that checks validity of enforce_cache to functions that do not have time_res, spat_res, age_res arguments. DONE.
